# Hi! 

I am a 16-year-old developer who writes both **code and poetry**.

I believe magic is basically applied physics- *wand* is logic and *spells* are still being found. 
Codes and words are the heroes behind the scenes we tend to ignore.

Some days I debug scripts *and some days I debug myself*.

I love to read books- the fiction that feel like therapy.
I love to code- the quite kind of stuff that listens and sticks.
I love red- the loud kind that screams chaos.

## What do I do?
- Build small tools that solve real life problems
- Explore possible solutions to problems people overlook
- Automate the boring
- Learn, write and ponder
- Question everything that does not make sense to me (and find something else that actually makes sense)
- Secret coding sessions between exam chaos

## Things I know
- python (home turf)
- physics (read Irodov 'cause I was bored?)
- keyboard (hindustani + basics of western)
- jupyter notebooks
- brainstorming - aggressively
